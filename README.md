# How to override the localization in the Flutter Calendar

A quick-start example to override the localization in the Flutter Calendar

By default, the calendar widget supports US English localizations. You can override the localization in the Flutter Event Calendar by using the extendibility options. To override localization, place the localization extendibility.dart file in the lib folder. Then, in the localization extendibility.dart file, override the required keys and add the delegate class for localization. Then, to override the localized words, invoke the delegate class.
